Usability Heuristic Analysis:
1. Visibility of system status: keep the user informed as to what is going on behind the scenes.

The user is informed what is going on with the simple instructional buttons located in the chat box area.

The submitted caption and photos immediately appear on the page.  This provides the user with prompt feedback that their submission succeeded.


2. Match between system and the real world: use concepts that are familiar.

Buttons are a common web feature that functions similarly to a real-world button.   We do not use acronyms.

The “Login with Facebook” buttons and “Upload...” buttons are commonly found on other websites.  The feed of pictures is similar to that of Facebook.

3. User control and freedom:  make things easy to do, and easy to undo.
In our application, the user can log in, log out, submit pictures with captions, and view submissions by scrolling down.   The logout button is placed in the top right which is standard. The application is pretty simple and there isn’t much needed freedom. However, the user is allowed to do what is needed to be done.

4. Consistency and standards: follow conventions; be internally consistent.
Everything is consistent, chat logs and formatting is all centered and nothing is strange.

The “Login with Facebook” button is standard and immediately recognizable.  

The logout button is on the top right, which is standard.  Submissions will always appear immediately beneath the “Add a Photo” box.

5. Error prevention: prevent errors from occurring in the first place.
The user must select a photo and type a caption before submitting.  This is made clear by the “Select File” and “Type a caption!” areas.

“Login with Facebook” makes obvious the requirement of a Facebook account.






6.  Recognition rather than recall: the user should be able to figure out how to achieve their goal by looking at the page.

There isn’t much needed information to remember. A simple chatting system, with just upload, chat.  The “Upload…” and “Type a caption for your photo” fields are self explanatory.

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use:  make frequent actions easy.  The system should be usable by novice and experienced users.
You can just press the enter key to submit a post. Also returning users don’t need to verify accounts again.  This is a simple site.

8.  Aesthetic and minimalist design: visible information should be relevant.
The login page is simple and direct.  The background picture of the black cat makes it easy to see the white title text and the blue login button.  The background also illustrates the content of the site - cat pictures.

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: errors should clearly describe the problem and suggest a solution.
Failing to enter a caption will display an error message “Please enter a caption!”  Until the user enters a caption, the text box in the submission area will read, “Type a caption for your photo!”

10. Help and documentation: the user should be able to find instructions if they are not able to figure something out.
The application is easy enough to use without any need of documentations. However, there is a small description text for users to read for the purpose of the application.


Contribution Documentation:

Kaitlin was the one who chose the theme and suggested the design for the cat chat application. We also used Kaitlin’s part 1 setup and repository for the application. She finished up many of the basic template of the application from the assignment and designed the cute paws.

Chris, Kirk, and Allan worked towards getting the picture sharing functionality working(Most difficult part). At first we were planning to do an uploading type thing but with the time constraint we decided to change it to a url image display method. Chris was able to get the name of the user to display correctly. Allan also implemented an audio feature when the paws are clicked on the application. Most of the struggles were minor setup stuff which were helped during office hours.

Adam was not feeling well this week so he helped Allan with writing up the readme. He was able to test the application when pushed live and analyzed the requirements we needed for the assignment.
